here are all the algorithm files again by reading everything and each and everyline, review each of these again in depth and find the root cause of this problem.

data: @metro-data.ts

Graph: @graph.ts

Algo: @direct-route.ts @route-discovery.ts @route-diversity.ts @route-enhancer.ts @route-pruning.ts @route-rationalization.ts @route-scoring.ts @route-validator.ts @routing.ts @transfer-route.ts @walking-route.ts

Here is the problem again:

Can you research on this bug now in depth why is it happening and how it can be fixed cleanly without causing anyother problems. I want you to find the complete root cause of this first after deeply reviewing the complete algorithm again go through the complete algorithm line by line in depth

In route from 6th road to bari imam I am getting this route

but don't you think we should also explore a better option which is redline to pims, walk to pims gate for fr-4 and then reach the destination directly which is a much better route with one transfer only. I want you to check this problem in depth on why am i not exploring the wallking routes correctly. use this data to verify data: @metro-data.ts

Route i am getting along with some other routes as well but this one is the one that should be replaced with the better walking route I think the part where we are switching to fr-3a is the problem, it should not be switching to fr-3a, instead it should be walking to pims gate and then taking fr-4 to the destination. This way we have less tranfers, we don't have to wait for fr-3a to arrive at pims metro, we can just walk to pims gate and take fr-4 to the destination. the walking distance is also 300-400 meters which is very reasonable and should be explored. Do you think it is being skipped because the below route is exact same route except for the walking distance? in that case shouldn't we use this route instead of the one i am getting as this has less tranfers? how are we checking the diversity of routes?

This is the walking shortcut:

IMPORTANT!!: I want you to find the root cause of this problem and fix it. I don't want a specific fix, I want you to find the root cause and fix it solving all the problems in depth for every other such problem.
